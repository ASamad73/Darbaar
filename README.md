<h1>Darbaar 👑</h1>
<p> An online multiplayer role-based guessing game inspired by the classic "Badshah Badshah ka Wazir kon". 
Players join rooms, get assigned secret roles, and use voting and deduction to find the "Chor" — or survive as one!

<h2>🚀 Features</h2>
<div>
  <h3>Login</h3>
</div>
<p>The login page serves as the secure gateway for users to access the Darbaar platform. Players enter their registered username and password to authenticate themselves. 
The system ensures that only verified users can proceed, maintaining game integrity and personalized access. Once logged in, users can choose between different gameplay options 
— joining random matches or playing with friends — while retaining their unique identity across game sessions.</p>

<div>
  <h3>Dashboard</h3>
</div>
<p>After successful login, users are directed to their personal Dashboard. This serves as the central hub for the game and has the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Direct buttons to start a game with anyone, play with friends, add friends, or update their profile</li>
  <li>A heading at top of the buttons displaying the total number of games the user has played</li>
</ul>
<p>The Dashboard simplifies navigation within the app and ensures users have a seamless starting point for their gaming experience.</p>

<div>
  <h3>Play Anyone</h3>
</div>
<p>This mode allows users to instantly join a public game with other random players. When a user selects this option:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Matchmaking Logic:</b> The system automatically pairs the player with three other users from the matchmaking pool and assigns them the roles (Badshah, Wazir, Sipahi, Chor) — which are   
  hidden. If enough players do not join within a set time, the system notifies the users and cancels the game initiation.</li>
  <li><b>In-Game Chat:</b> Players can send messages to all other participants in the game using the built-in chat feature, allowing for discussion, bluffing, or strategizing.</li>
  <li><b>Voting Mechanism:</b> Players cast votes against other players within the game interface. These votes are later revealed to the Badshah for making their final guess.</li>
  <li><b>Guessing Phase:</b> Once voting concludes, the Badshah can click the "Guess" button to view the votes and make an informed guess on who the Wazir is.</li>
  <li><b>End Game Option:</b>Badshah has the option to end the game, which lets the Chor Win and every other player lose</li>
</ul>

<div>
  <h3>Play Friends</h3>
</div>
<p>This mode is very similar to the "Play Anyone" mode except for the matchmaking logic. In this mode, a game only starts if all the players are bidirectionally friends with each other</p>
<br/>

<div>
  <h3>Add Friends</h3>  
</div>
  <p>The Add Friends functionality lets players build their in-game social network. Through this feature, players can add a user to their friends list through their unique username view their game activity, i.e., number of games played</p>

<div>
  <h3>Update Profile</h3>
</div>
<p>This feature allows users to manage and edit their profile details - username and password - seamlessly</p>
