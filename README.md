  <h3>🏠 Dashboard</h3>
</div>
<p>After successful login, users are directed to their personal Dashboard. This serves as the central hub for the game and has the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Direct buttons to start a game with anyone, play with friends, add friends, or update their profile</li>
  <li>A heading at top of the buttons displaying the total number of games the user has played</li>
</ul>
<p>The Dashboard simplifies navigation within the app and ensures users have a seamless starting point for their gaming experience.</p>

<div>
  <h3>🌐 Play with Anyone</h3>
</div>
<p>This mode allows users to instantly join a public game with other random players. When a user selects this option:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Matchmaking Logic:</b> The system automatically pairs the player with three other users from the matchmaking pool and assigns them the roles (Badshah, Wazir, Sipahi, Chor) — which are hidden.  
  If enough players do not join within a set time, the system notifies the users and cancels the game initiation.</li>
  <li><b>Role Assignment & Start:</b> Once four players are matched, roles are assigned randomly and hidden from other players. The game officially starts, and each player sees only their role with a list of the other participants.</li>
  <li><b>In-Game Chat:</b> Players can send messages to all other participants in the game using the built-in chat feature, allowing for discussion, bluffing, or strategizing.</li>
  <li><b>Voting Mechanism:</b> Players cast votes against other players within the game interface. These votes are later revealed to the Badshah for making their final guess.</li>
  <li><b>Guessing Phase:</b> Once voting concludes, the Badshah can click the "Guess" button to view the votes and make an informed guess on who the Chor is.</li>
  <li><b>End Game Option:</b> Players have the option to end the game after the guess phase, which resets the game session for all participants.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Dashboard simplifies navigation within the app and ensures users have a seamless starting point for their gaming experience.</p>
